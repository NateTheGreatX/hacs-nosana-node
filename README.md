# Nosana Node Integration

A Home Assistant integration to monitor Nosana nodes using a Solana address.

## Features
- Fetches node specifications from `https://dashboard.k8s.prd.nos.ci/api/nodes/<solana_address>/specs` (primary).
- Fetches state from `https://<solana_address>.node.k8s.prd.nos.ci/node/info` (sets state to "offline" if unavailable).
- Fetches benchmark metrics from `https://dashboard.k8s.prd.nos.ci/api/benchmarks/generic-benchmark-data`.
- Sensors for node specs, state, and performance metrics.

## Installation
1. Install HACS in Home Assistant.
2. Add this repository as a custom repository in HACS (type: Integration).
3. Install the "Nosana Node" integration.
4. Add the integration via `Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration`.
5. Enter your Nosana nodeâ€™s Solana address.

## Configuration
- **Solana Address**: The address of your Nosana node (e.g., `67qvHLKGmM62RLevcGRde1aWhEPU3njDiemvX6RZEX6i`).
- **Update Interval**: Polling frequency in seconds (default: 300).
